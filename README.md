# CovidFAQs
A Chatbot created using Dialogflow that answers FAQs related to Covid 19 virus

Completed the Day 1 of the 30 Days of AI Masterclass

In today's sessions learned to create a Chatbot using Dialogflow. 

I have created a Chat box using DialogFlow that answers FAQs of the Covid 19 virus and schedules an appointment for the covid 19 vaccine.

I have integrated the Chat bot with the Messenger service of the Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100087117322835

Check out my project by clicking on the "Send Message" button of this page and chatting with the bot.
